## Next.js

I've really enjoyed playing around with next.js. It's been year since Ive tried to build a website and its really cool what you can do these days.

## Creating my blog

I've been wanting to create a blog so I can document my journey into tech. Just to have something to look back on in a couple years to see how far I've come. It's taken me a few weeks to figure out how to create a blog with markdown. It's really the first project I've done where I had to figure how to do it. With alot of trial and error and copy and pasting, this is what I've come up with.
<br>

## Whats to come...

Im hoping to add this blog to Netlify cms. Currently I am using markdown files in my site directory. I would like to be able to make post simpler so I dont have to rebuild the site each time. A headless CMS seams like an easy option, but who knows I may try to create a simple CMS of my own to learn database and backend stuff.  
<br>

Thats about it. Im not one to spend alot of time writing, but will try to make weekly post.

Take care!
